# Community Circles Platform Stack

This document outlines the recommended technical stack for the Community Circles platform, aligning with the product vision and MVP requirements.

## Client Applications
- **Web:** Next.js and React for the main responsive experience, leveraging server-side rendering for SEO-sensitive community pages.
- **Mobile:** React Native for iOS and Android with platform-specific modules for media capture, notifications, and in-app purchases where needed.
- **Desktop (optional):** Electron shell reusing the web codebase for power users and moderators requiring multi-window workflows.

## Backend Services
- **GraphQL Gateway:** Apollo Federation gateway coordinating domain services and enforcing authentication/authorization.
- **Domain Services:** Independently deployable services for Auth, Community, Circles/Payments, Posts, Chat, Voice, Search, Analytics, and Moderation.
- **API Patterns:** Use GraphQL for primary client interaction, with service-to-service gRPC/REST where latency or streaming requirements dictate.

## Data & Storage
- **Primary Database:** PostgreSQL with logical replication for read replicas and analytical extracts.
- **Caching & Queues:** Redis for session storage, rate limiting, pub/sub fan-out, and lightweight job queues.
- **Object Storage:** S3-compatible storage (e.g., AWS S3 or Cloudflare R2) fronted by a CDN for media assets, voice recordings, and file libraries.
- **Analytics Warehouse:** ClickHouse or BigQuery for behavioral analytics, retention funnels, and creator dashboards.
- **Search Index:** OpenSearch (or Elasticsearch-compatible service) for community, post, and member discovery experiences.

## Real-Time & Media
- **Chat:** WebSockets (via services like Socket.IO or native ws) with presence tracking and message persistence in PostgreSQL/Redis.
- **Voice Rooms:** WebRTC powered by an SFU such as LiveKit, Janus, or mediasoup to support Public Center voice lounges.
- **Notifications:** Push delivery through Firebase Cloud Messaging/Apple Push Notification Service and web push; in-app notifications backed by Redis streams or Kafka topics.

## Eventing & Integrations
- **Event Bus:** Kafka or Redpanda for durable event streaming, feeding analytics, moderation pipelines, and outbound webhooks.
- **Observability:** OpenTelemetry instrumentation with centralized tracing (Jaeger/Tempo), metrics (Prometheus), and log aggregation (Loki).
- **Payments:** Stripe for subscription tiers, payouts, tax handling, and dispute resolution workflows.

## AI & Safety
- **Moderation Copilots:** Leverage hosted LLM APIs or fine-tuned models with human-in-the-loop review; store decisions with audit trails.
- **Content Summaries:** Background jobs generate summaries/highlights for long threads and voice sessions using secure model endpoints.
- **Privacy Controls:** Edge or on-device inference for sensitive content where feasible, honoring regional compliance requirements.

## DevOps & Tooling
- **Infrastructure:** Terraform for infrastructure as code, with Kubernetes (managed service) orchestrating microservices.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions or CircleCI pipelines with automated testing, linting, and canary deployments.
- **Feature Flags:** Use LaunchDarkly or open-source alternatives for staged rollouts and A/B experiments.
- **Security:** Secrets management via HashiCorp Vault or cloud-native equivalents; automated dependency scanning and SAST/DAST tooling.

## Compliance & Governance
- Enforce GDPR/CCPA data subject rights with automated export/delete workflows.
- Maintain audit logs for moderation actions, financial events, and high-risk admin operations.
- Provide SOC 2-aligned controls covering access management, change management, and incident response.

This stack ensures the platform can deliver real-time community experiences, creator monetization, and safety requirements while remaining modular for future roadmap expansions.
